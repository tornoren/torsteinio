Someone said: First we shape our tools, then they shape us.

Excel is an excellent tool for long-term planning in a low-res perspective in a rigorous | unflexible manner.

Word is good for producing longstanding documents that dictate the solutions long after the problems were forgotten.

Powerpoint is a great helper when you want to persuade or put your foot in the door. And many gatekeepers require a deck to say yes.

None of these are bad tools. Nor do they represent any malign influence in the world.

There is  some flexibility for you to choose right the tool when addressing a problem. But as a rule, the problem at hand determines what tool is right for the job.

So: Seek out the problems that require the tools you want to emulate.
