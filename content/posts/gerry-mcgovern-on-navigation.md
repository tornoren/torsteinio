In Gerry McGovern's book on top tasks he describes seven principles of effective digital navigation:


1. **Momentum**  
Keep people moving forward


2. **Unity**  
Make navigation as unified as possible.  
3. **Twins**  
Design for the journey customers are on.  
4. **Minimalism**  
Have navigation take up as little space as is practical.  
5. **Clarity**  
Navigation must immediately communicate what it is – and what it is not.  
6. **Fidelity**  
A link is a promise – navigation should keep its promises.  
7. **Magnetism**  
Maximize clean magnetism, minimize dirty magnetism.
